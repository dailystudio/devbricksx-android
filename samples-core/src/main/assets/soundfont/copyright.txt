Contributors (quoting from README):

"Fluid was constructed in part from samples found in the public domain that I
edited/cleaned/remixed/programmed and largely from recordings of my own and
in conjunction with the people below who helped along the way:

Suren M. Seron
Scott Hanan
Steve Aupperle
Chris Gillman
Alex Taubr
Chris Prola
Andrew Klenk
Winfried Hubbe 
Dylan
Tim
Gort
Uros Katic 
Ethan Winer (http://www.ethanwiner.com)"

I'd also like to thank Alexander Ryan, Dan Reagan, and Thomas Hammer for 
hosting the project for so many years. Without them, distribution would have 
been impossible.

And also Tobe Smithe, for bringing this to more people through Ubuntu.
