## Quick Setup
To use **DevBricks X** Libraries in your application, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Installation
Libraries are distributed via jcenter. Add the following dependencies in build.gradle of your application.


#### Jcenter

```groovy
repositories { 
    jcenter()
}
```

#### Dependencies

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Basic Library for Android development
    implementation "com.dailystudio:devbricksx:$devbricksx_version"

    // (Optional) Annotations and processors to generate low-level facilities, such as Dao, Database, etc. 
    implementation "com.dailystudio:devbricksx-java-annotations:$devbricksx_version"
    kapt "com.dailystudio:devbricksx-java-compiler:$devbricksx_version"
    // (Optional) If you use the feature above, DO NOT forget this line 
    kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:2.2.5"

    // (Optional) Annotations and processors to generate high-level utils, such ViewModel, Fragment, etc.
    implementation "com.dailystudio:devbricksx-kotlin-annotations:$devbricksx_version"
    kapt "com.dailystudio:devbricksx-kotlin-compiler:$devbricksx_version"
}
```

#### Latest version

```groovy
devbricksx_version = "0.6.8"
```

### Step 2: Application initialization (Optional)
This step helps you to integrate parts of utilities automatically, such as Logging facilities. 

Extends your application from **DevBricksApplication**:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : DevBricksApplication() {

    override fun isDebugBuild(): Boolean {
        return BuildConfig.DEBUG
    }
    
}
```
The **BuildConfig** is the one generated for your top-level application not those for modules. It provides information about your build type to the library.

Then declare it in your **`AndroidMenifest.xml`**:

``` xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application
        android:name=".MyApplication">
        ...
    </application>
    ...
</manifest>
```

## Usage
Now you can enjoy this library in your way. The facilities provided in this library include different topics, please read the instructions carefully in each topic for details.

- [**Logging**](./docs/logging.md)

    An enhanced logging system which can turn on/off debug outputs automatically.

- [**Gloabl Context**](./docs/globalcontext.md)

    A global context that you can use anywhere in your code without memory leaks.

- [**Database**](./docs/database.md)
    
    A set of utilities to simplify the usage of Android Room components. It can generate Room, Dao, Database, and Repository for a class through one annotation.

- [**UI**](./docs/ui.md)
    
    Plenty of classes to simplify high-level development. Combine with [**Database**](./docs/database.md) facilities, you can save an object in database and then represent it in a list view with less than 20 lines of code.
